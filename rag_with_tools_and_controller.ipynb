    "# Problem Statement: \"The Automated Investment Risk Analyst\"\n",
    "# The Business Context: You are a Quantitative Researcher at a hedge fund. Your job is to monitor portfolio companies for risks. A sudden drop in revenue is a \"lagging indicator\"—by the time you see it, it's often too late. You need to connect these financial dips to operational events immediately.\n",
    "# The Data Challenge: You have two disconnected datasets for a company called \"Solaris AI\":\n",
    "# The Hard Numbers (financials.csv): A structured dataset containing quarterly Revenue, OpEx, and Churn Rates.\n",
    "# Constraint: LLMs are bad at math. You cannot just ask \"What is the average?\" and trust the answer. You need an engine that can execute code.\n",
    "# The Soft Signals (meeting_notes.txt): Unstructured text logs from the CEO's board meetings.\n",
    "# Constraint: This file is too large to paste into a prompt every time. You need a retrieval system to find only the relevant paragraphs.\n",
    "# The Goal: Build a unified LangChain Agent that acts as a Controller. When a user asks a complex question, the Agent must intelligently route the sub-tasks to the correct \"Brain\":\n",
    "# Logic/Math: A Pandas Agent that writes Python code to query the CSV.\n",
    "# Context/Search: A Vector Store Retriever (FAISS) that performs semantic search on the text.\n",
    "# The Question:\n",
    "# \"Using the Financial Data, identify which Quarter had the highest Churn Rate. Then, use the Meeting Notes to explain the specific operational incident that caused this spike.\"\n"
