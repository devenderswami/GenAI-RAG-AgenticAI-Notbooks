      "Query: What is Ashwagandha coffee?\n",
      "Answer: Ashwagandha coffee is a modern fusion trend that combines roasted coffee with powdered ashwagandha, an herb widely used in Indian traditions (file_path: /Users/devenderswami/GenAI/GenAI-NoteBooks/coffee_pages/01_ashwagandha_coffee_adaptogenic_latte.html). The goal is to enjoy a familiar coffee experience while incorporating earthy, slightly bitter herbal notes (file_path: /Users/devenderswami/GenAI/GenAI-NoteBooks/coffee_pages/01_ashwagandha_coffee_adaptogenic_latte.html). Home cooks often prepare it like a latte, adding spices for balance (file_path: /Users/devenderswami/GenAI/GenAI-NoteBooks/coffee_pages/01_ashwagandha_coffee_adaptogenic_latte.html). This reflects a broader movement of adapting herbs to everyday beverages (file_path: /Users/devenderswami/GenAI/GenAI-NoteBooks/coffee_pages/01_ashwagandha_coffee_adaptogenic_latte.html).\n"
