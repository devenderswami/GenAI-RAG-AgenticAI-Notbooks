    <h1>Credit Card Billing and Payment Policy</h1>
    <p>Customers must ensure timely payment of their credit card bills to avoid late payment fees and interest charges.</p>
    <p>The due date for payment will be mentioned on every monthly statement.</p>
    <p>Partial payments will attract interest on the remaining balance until full payment is made.</p>

    <h2>Rewards and Cashback</h2>
    <p>Each purchase made using the credit card earns reward points or cashback as per the ongoing offer.</p>
    <p>Reward points can be redeemed for vouchers, merchandise, or converted into statement credit.</p>

    <h2>Security and Fraud Prevention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Never share your OTP or CVV with anyone, including bank officials.</li>
        <li>Immediately report any unauthorized transaction to the bank’s helpline.</li>
        <li>Lost cards should be blocked instantly using the mobile app or helpline number.</li>
    </ul>
