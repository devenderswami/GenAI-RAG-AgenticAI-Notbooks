      "4.  **Check Availability:** This is crucial! Many clever names might already be taken. Be prepared to add numbers or slight variations.\n",
      "5.  **Avoid Anything Offensive:** Even if it's meant as a joke, ensure it won't be misinterpreted or cause offense.\n",

      "*   **@AkashTheDream:** A positive and slightly whimsical take.\n",
      "*   **@AkashOnly:** Like \"cash only,\" implying your tweets are exclusive or premium content (humorously, of course!).\n",

      "*   **@JustAkashThings:** A common meme format, implying relatable (and perhaps quirky) content.\n",
      "*   **@AkashicRecords:** A clever play on the esoteric term, suggesting you hold all the knowledge (or just a lot of random thoughts).\n",
      "*   **@AkashTheMenace:** An ironic take if you're actually quite harmless.\n",
      "*   **@AkashTheMistake:** If you like self-deprecating humor.\n",

      "*   **@AkashMode:** Like you're always in \"Akash mode.\"\n",

Think of it like this: it's an entity that takes input from the world around it, processes that information, and then makes a decision to perform an action.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Perception:** This is how the agent \"sees\" or \"hears\" its environment. It uses **sensors** to gather information. For example, a self-driving car uses cameras, radar, and lidar as sensors. A chatbot like me uses the text you type as its perception.\n",
      "2.  **Environment:** This is the world the agent operates in. It could be a physical space (like a factory floor for a robot), a digital space (like a website for a web crawler), or even a game world.\n",
      "3.  **Actuation:** Once the agent decides what to do, it performs an action using **effectors**. For a robot, effectors might be wheels, grippers, or robotic arms. For a chatbot, it's generating text responses.\n",
      "4.  **Agent Function:** This is the \"brain\" of the agent. It maps percepts (what it perceives) to actions (what it does). This function can be simple or incredibly complex, depending on the agent's design.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are actually different types of AI agents, often categorized by their level of sophistication:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Simple Reflex Agents:** These are the most basic. They act purely based on the current percept, ignoring past history. Think of a thermostat that turns on the AC when it gets too hot – it doesn't remember how hot it was yesterday.\n",
      "*   **Model-Based Reflex Agents:** These agents maintain an internal \"model\" of the world, which helps them understand how the environment works and what their actions might lead to. They use past percepts to update this model.\n",
      "*   **Goal-Based Agents:** These agents have specific goals they're trying to achieve. They consider future actions and their outcomes to find a sequence of actions that will lead them to their goal. A pathfinding algorithm in a GPS is a good example.\n",
      "*   **Utility-Based Agents:** These are even more advanced. They not only have goals but also a \"utility function\" that measures how \"good\" a particular state or outcome is. They try to choose actions that maximize their expected utility, making them more rational in complex situations where there might be trade-offs.\n",
      "*   **Learning Agents:** Many agents, especially the more complex ones, incorporate a learning element. They can improve their performance over time by analyzing the results of their actions and adjusting their agent function.\n",
      "\n",
